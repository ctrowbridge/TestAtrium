This project contains a set of automated tests to check the Open Atrium application.
Automation is performed using Selenium.

The Bitnami Open Atrium stack was used for testing. This can be downloaded from
https://bitnami.com/stack/openatrium

Assumptions:
 1) The Site Title is set to "Cindy's Site" when the Bitnami Atrium installer
    is run.  If this is not the case, the siteTitle field in the Basic.java file
    needs to be updated.
