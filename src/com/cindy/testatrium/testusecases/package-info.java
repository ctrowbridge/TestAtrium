 *
 * Open Atrium Use Cases
 * 
 * So Open Atrium like I said can be used for a lot of things.
 * 
 * It can be used to build something like an extensible intranet, where you are
 * sharing information with staff, affiliates or chapters of your organization,
 * or members of your team in a centralized place where people can find
 * documents, learn about events, have discussions with one another and so
 * forth.
 * 
 * It can be used as a social collaboration platform where you are really
 * engaging citizens or engaging constituents on sharing their ideas, sharing
 * their stories and then sharing back with them information that your
 * organization or your community is doing.
 * 
 * A knowledge management system, we use this, and you're going to see this
 * today for Open Atrium, Open Atrium's documentation system is actually built
 * on Open Atrium. It's used to manage the various documents that are needed to
 * make sure you know how to use Open Atrium, and it's great because you can use
 * it as a way to publish documents, but in the case of Open Atrium, we've
 * actually then used it to engage community members in providing and
 * contributing additional documentation and you'll see that today, it's a great
 * flexibility in the system.
 * 
 * You can also use it for learning management. The ability to track for an
 * educational institution or even an organization or company that is wanting to
 * provide some learning to their staff can engage and use the calendar feature
 * for of course being a calendar, can use the multimedia tools to provide
 * lectures or lessons online, and use the discussions and documentation
 * sections to really provide that kind of online classroom for people.
